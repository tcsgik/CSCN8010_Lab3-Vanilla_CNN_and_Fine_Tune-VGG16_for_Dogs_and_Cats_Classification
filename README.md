# Lab Name: Lab3 - Vanilla_CNN_and_Fine_Tune-VGG16_for_Dogs_and_Cats_Classification

## Lab Synopsis

This Lab uses Python and Jupyter Notebook in a VS Code environment to deal with a Dogs vs Cats dataset. Split the three datasets into a train, validation, and test set to train CNN and VGG16 models. Explore the relative performance of the best two models with CNN and VGG16. Finally, present a visualization presentation of the table and graph.
